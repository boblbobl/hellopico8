# Hello

This is my very first attempt to create a small PICO-8 game.

I've used this project as a way to learn how to do basic game mechanics like collision detection, and just in general how to setup a new PICO-8 development environment.

To start the game, I usually just run PICO-8 from the terminal using the run command:

```
pico8 -run hello.p8
```

Here are a list of things I'm still exploring:

- [ ] Improve character map collision detection
- [ ] Game over state
